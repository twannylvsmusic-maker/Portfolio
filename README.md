## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Puzzle Generation Algorithm
The core algorithm efficiently places words in various directions while respecting shape constraints and avoiding collisions:

```python
def generate_puzzle(words, shape, allow_vertical=True, allow_horizontal=True, allow_diagonal=True):
    # Initialize grid based on shape
    grid = create_shape_grid(shape)
    
    # Sort words by length (longest first) for better placement
    sorted_words = sorted(words, key=len, reverse=True)
    
    placed_words = []
    for word in sorted_words:
        # Try multiple placement strategies
        if place_word_in_grid(word, grid, placed_words, allow_vertical, allow_horizontal, allow_diagonal):
            placed_words.append(word)
    
    return grid, placed_words
```

### Shape System
Modular shape system using mask-based placement, allowing for easy addition of new shapes without modifying core logic.

### Export Pipeline
Robust export system supporting both PDF (ReportLab) and Word (python-docx) formats with consistent formatting and professional layouts.

## 🚨 Beta Features

**Image Upload Feature**: The image upload functionality is currently in beta. Additional improvements and enhancements are coming in future updates. This feature allows users to upload custom images to use as puzzle shapes, but may have limitations in shape detection and optimization.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python not found**: Install Python 3.8 or later
2. **Dependencies fail**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` manually
3. **Port in use**: Change the port in `app.py` (line with `app.run()`)
4. **Browser cache**: Press Ctrl+F5 to hard refresh

### Performance Tips

- Use shorter word lists for faster generation
- Avoid very complex custom shapes for better performance
- Clear browser cache if experiencing display issues
